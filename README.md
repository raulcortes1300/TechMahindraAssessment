# React TypeScript Data Table

A simple React TypeScript project that fetches and displays data in a table with pagination, filtering, and user deletion features.

## Features

- Fetch data from an API endpoint (https://reqres.in/ in this example).
- Display paginated data in a table.
- Filter data based on user input.
- Simulate user deletion (since the API does not physically delete users).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
